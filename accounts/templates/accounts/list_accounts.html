                <p>For every account you use with your game client, there are actually two accounts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Login Server Account</li>
                    <li>World Server Account</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Login Server</h5>
                <p>The first account is created on the login server. These are the accounts you see here in the list on this
                page.  From the player's perspective on the game client, this account is the one you use to
                reach the Server Select screen to get a list of available servers. Each server you see at server
                select is called a "world server".  When the world server's come online, they have to register with
                a login server so that players have a way to find and connect to them. Once a player selects a world
                server, the login server does a hand off with the world server - connecting the player to that world
                server.</p>
                <h5>World Server</h5>
                <p>Players are first connected to the world server at the Character Select screen.</p>
                <p>A world server can register to multiple login servers.  For example, the EQA world server is registered
                with, and thus discoverable, from the EQA, TAKP, and EQEMU login servers.  When a player reaches the
                Character Select screen in the game client, that is the first point that they are actually connected
                to a world server.</p>
                <p>While it is possible to use multiple login servers to connect to a world server, you cannot use the
                same account name.  The reason for this is simple: each login server operates independently and will not
                stop you from creating an account name that is unique from its perspective.  In practice this means
                that TAKP, EQA, and EQEMU could all have accounts named Soandso.  However, a world server requires account
                names to be unique as well.  So the first login server to connect to a world server gets to reserve an
                account name.</p>
                <h6>1017 Error at Server Select</h6>
                <p>When you try to connect to a world server and get a 1017 error, this usually means that your account
                name is not unique on that world server and was already taken by another login server.</p>
